# AI Penetration Test Remediation Plan Generation
## Overview
This project was developed as part of my IPRO (Introduction to the Profession) course at Illinois Institute of Technology in Fall 2024. It is a web-based tool that automates the analysis of PDF-format penetration test reports to generate structured and actionable mitigation plans using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model via the OpenAI API.

Upon uploading a report, the system extracts key information and generates:
* A short description of each identified vulnerability
* A recommended mitigation strategy
* A severity ranking
* An estimated cost of remediation

All outputs are stored in a relational database hosted on AWS RDS, and the website itself is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. The application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.
This system streamlines the cybersecurity remediation process by transforming complex penetration testing documents into a clear, prioritized, and budget-aware action plan.

## Key Concept Applied
- **AI-Powered Document Analysis**

  Used OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model to extract, summarize, and interpret data from unstructured PDF penetration test reports.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**

  Translated technical vulnerabilities into human-readable, actionable items using GPT-based language generation.
- **Web Development**

  Developed a full-stack web application using Flask for backend logic and HTML/CSS for the frontend interface.
- **File Handling & PDF Parsing**

  Extracted text content from uploaded PDF reports using Python-based PDF parsing libraries
- **Database Integration**

  Stored extracted data, generated plans, and user uploads in a relational database hosted on AWS RDS.
- **Cloud Deployment**

  Deployed the web application on AWS EC2, ensuring remote accessibility and scalable performance.
- **Security Awareness & Risk Prioritization**

  Incorporated severity ranking and cost estimation to support real-world remediation planning.
